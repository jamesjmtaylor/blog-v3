# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Because you want a disciplined, innovative worker with a mean streak for pragmatism and a lifelong passion for learning. I take great pride in delivering delightful experiences to users of my mobile applications, and learned Sketch and Lottie to make up for the lack of a designer on my personal projects. I quickly realized though that an app is all for naught without a solid backend to support it. So I used the Kotlin from my native Android work to jumpstart into Spring Boot server development. Now, with full command of the stack Iâ€™ve returned to delivering holistic applications for my users.

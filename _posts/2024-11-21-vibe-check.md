It's been a pretty tumultuous month.  Amidst work, contracting, family responsibilities, the election, and Intermediate Climb School I feel like I've been stretched pretty thin.  I've also been struggling with what exactly to write.  I didn't want to get too far into the politics of what just happened because it's been covered by far more competent people than me in a level of detail I couldn't hope to match.  Suffice it to say I hope this serves as the DNC's wake-up call that the era of identity politics is dead and that we need to come up with a value proposition that the silent majority, not just the  democratic base, can get behind.

At work leadership has buckled down on the concept of monthly releases, regardless of whether or not that really benefits our users or is even truly advisable.  My part-time contracting continues, although the backlog there looks like it might wind down over the holidays.  Intermediate Climb School has completed the rock climbing portion of the course, and will continue in January with the snow skills portion.  Which leaves family responsibilities.  One of my kiddos recently had their birthday, my wife is about to have her birthday, and we're in the midst of Thanksgiving and Christmas preperations.  So I have my work cut out for me.  

How about you, how are you holding up?  You can let us know in the comments, or email me directly.  Until next time.

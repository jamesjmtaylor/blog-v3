I recently had to develop a test framework for a client.  One of the requirements was that the tests had to be able to interact with elements outside of the app in order to provide a full "end-to-end" test suite.  This alone ruled out native Espresso tests, which I had used in the past, because Espresso is only capable of interacting with views within the app.

After a short stint of research I found Appium to be pretty much the industry standard for these kinds of tests.  In this post I plan to take you through the steps that I took to setup, write, and run my own Appium tests.  

The first step was to install [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases). Appium inspector provides a graphical user interface with which to record interactions with and make assertions against the visual elements presented on your device, including elements outside of your app's process.  This is particularly useful if your app uses an OAuth2.0 Authorization Framework.  

In order to connect to your device you'll also need to download Appium, install its drivers, and run the program in your terminal.  This can be done with the following commands:

```
brew install appium && 
appium driver install xcuitest &&
appium driver install uiautomator2 &&
appium
```

Once you have In Appium running in your terminal you will need to specify the Capabilities in the Appium Inspector's JSON Representation block. These include listing which app package to test, which activity to launch, with which automation driver to run the tests, and so on.  Note that if you specify an applicationIdSuffix in your `build.gradle` you will need to exclude that suffix from the `appActivity` capability. When adding Appium DesiredCapabilities to the test class that instantiates the AppiumDriver later, you'll want to make sure to prefix the capabilities with “appium”, i.e. \`caps.setCapability("appium:deviceName", "89SY0AWBN”);\`.  If you don’t you’ll get the error “IllegalArgumentException: Illegal key values seen in w3c capabilities“ After creating your capabilities set make sure to click the save icon.

Once the Appium Inspector session is started you can record the commands that you execute by tapping on the camera icon in the top menu.  The recorded instructions will appear in the “Recorder” tab.  These will be important for copying and pasting into the test classes of your test project in the next step. If a view doesn’t reflect what the device is showing, click the “Refresh Source & Screenshot” button in the top menu.

In order to create an executable .jar you'll need to create a new maven project in the editor of your choice. A lot of the old Appium documentation and Stack Overflow posts that you'll find will recommend using Eclipse.  Eclipse is OK, but I personally prefer IntelliJ CE, and ultimately found it to be just as capable.   If you start a new IntelliJ Java project, make sure to use the maven (not gradle!) build system.  As an Android developer that's used to the gradle build system, this caught me up for a while.  The reason I ultimately switched back to maven is because the majority of the documentation that you'll find for creating exportable binaries (including the documentation for [AWS Device Farm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/test-types-appium-integrate.html)) use the pom.xml file syntax and not that of build.gradle. 

In IntelliJ you can download new maven dependencies with the hotkey CMD + Shift + I.  For an Appium test project your maven pom.xml should look something like this:

In order to generate test .jar files that you can run remotely you will need to install selenium driver, which can be done with \`brew install selenium-server\`.  You will also need the maven build framework, which can be installed with \`brew install maven\`. Once selenium is installed you can run 

\`/opt/homebrew/opt/selenium-server/bin/selenium-server standalone --port 4444\` 

When uploading to your remote execution environment (in my case AWS Device Farm) you should specifically upload `<your_project_directory_here>/target/zip-with-dependencies.zip\`.  This file is generated with the command \`mvn clean package -DskipTests=true\`.

And that's it!  I hope you found this blog post entry useful.  Cross-platform mobile app testing isn't a skill most mobile developers commonly use, and I found there to be a lot of gotchas.  After talking about these with Appium veterans, I get the sense that this isn't just an effect of being new to the framework, but rather just long-standing idiosyncrasies of Appium.   Perhaps a more modern, intuitive, mobile testing framework will come along, but for the time being Appium seems to be the only real choice for cross-platform UI testing.

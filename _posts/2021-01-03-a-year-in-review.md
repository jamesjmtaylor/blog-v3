 Last year I [posted my New Years's resolutions](https://jjmtaylor.com/new-years-resolutions/) and discussed my hopes and ambitions for 2020.  Needless to say, things didn't exactly go as planned.  I had three resolutions.   The first was to do 3 sets of push ups every day.  As the pandemic unfolded that evolved into "do 50 push-ups prior to each serving of alcohol that I consumed.  Generally that meant 50-100 pushups a day, translating into roughly 20,000 pushups over the course of the year.  The second was to  limit my gaming to 7 hours a week.  The lockdown very quickly put the kibosh on that as gaming over Discord became my only social outlet. The third was to write a trading algorithm that integrates with an online trading RESTful API. <a href="https://www.strategic-options.com/insight/2019/06/13/the-best-and-worst-stock-and-option-trading-apis/"> I used this developer's blog as a point of entry</a> and pursued his recommendation concerning TD Ameritrade.  I immediately ran into various issues with the API.  I spent a couple weeks on the project, contacted support (which was unresponsive), and finally abandoned the project.  [Reading through his update](https://www.strategic-options.com/insight/2020/05/17/update-2020-the-best-and-worst-stock-futures-and-option-trading-apis/), it appears that I wasn't the only one who ran into issues.

I plan to make this year's resolutions more concerned with recovering from the fallout of last year.  Because my friends often only gamed during the evening, my early-morning programming became unworkable.  After I get the vaccine I'd like to resume in-person board gaming with friends local to Portland.  This should allow me to start going to bed sooner and resume my early morning programming. My second resolution is to learn a new programming language, Rust, and a new programming environment, microcontrollers.  I've already done a fair amount of work on Raspberry Pis, to include toy breadboard circuit projects, a media center for the kids, and a retropi Gameboy for long car trips.  MCUs seem like the next logical step from my past work on SBCs.  Based on a recommendation from a friend I'm considering getting a couple [ESP-32S Development Boards](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q576VWZ/?coliid=I3KEWSWP6VBEXZ&colid=2WNBCWH4M458P&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it).  I plan to use one to upgrade my fluid resistance spinner for my road bike to a Bluetooth connected sensor conforming to the FTMS profile.   The second one I plan to use to construct a ruggedized anemometer for my catamaran. I'll probably only be able to complete one of the projects this year, but I'll keep the second as a stretch goal. Happy New Year!

So, I’ve finished the coding dojo career course.  Here are my biggest takeaways:

1. Know the difference between Agency and Corporate recruiters and the advantages/disadvantages of each
2. Look up the github of the team that you’re interviewing for.  See what their code style is like and try to imitate it if you’re given a coding challenge.
3. Connect with as many recruiters and Coding Dojo alumni as possible!  Roshawn had us go through 10 pages of results for ‘Technical Recruiter’ and 10 pages for ‘Coding Dojo’ and request a connection with each and every one.  Surprisingly mostly of them just accepted, no questions asked.
4. Make a personal appeal with each linked in message (which should be your primary means of marketing yourself).  Examples include noting that a recruiter plays in a band (“That’s a badass band man!  When are you guys playing next?”), plays boardgames (“I LOVE Dominion!”), or supports a cause you care about (“lack of diversity in the workplace is a critical shortcoming of the tech world”).  Such a personal connection ensures that you stand out to a recruiter, rather than being lost in the crowd.

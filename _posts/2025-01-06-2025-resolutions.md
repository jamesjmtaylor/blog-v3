I've been doing new years resolution blogs for five years now.  I know they probably don't make for the most engrossing reading, but they serve an important function for me personally.  A [2019 paper by the American Psychological Association](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-45131-001) found that sharing your goals increased your likelihood of achieving them.  Given that less than 10% of Americans accomplish their goals according to a [2024 Forbes survey](https://www.forbes.com/health/mind/new-year-resolutions-survey-2024/), and I'm currently batting at a consistent average of 2 out of 3 goals per year, I'd say something must be working. [Last year's resolutions](https://jjmtaylor.com/2024-resolutions/) were no different:

* Update my Worldwide Equipment Guide app to use the new Odin API
* Climb three new mountains.
* Start Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

The first goal was the 1 in 3 that I didn't accomplish. It's kind of hard to prioritize personal projects when startups are willing to pay you to work on their projects part time.  I also started ICS in September, which made WEG app work less feasible, but allowed me to knock out my goal of taking the course.  I was able to summit Mount Theilsen in May, Colchuck Peak in June, and Rooster Rock in August.  I also summited Mt Hood again, this time via the West Crater Rim, and completed a winter climb of Mt. Saint Helens.  I anticipate that new summits will become increasingly difficult as the number of mountains that I haven't climbed in the Pacific Northwest decreases. Nevertheless, I plan to carry over last year's resolution of three new mountains into 2025.  Which brings us to the meat of this month's post: my new resolutions for 2025!

* Climb three new mountains
* Complete Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)
* Start my masters in Computer Science at OSU

If all goes well I should complete ICS in March.  Once I graduate I hope to climb Mt. Rainier with my classmates.  I'd also like to climb Mt. Adams with my brother, and will end up climbing a third mountain by assisting with this year's Introduction to Alpine Climbing course.  I'm still waiting to hear back on my application to [start postgraduate education in the Fall](https://jjmtaylor.com/postgraduate-education/), but I don't anticipate any issues there.  What about you?  Feel free to share any new year's resolutions that you have in the comments.

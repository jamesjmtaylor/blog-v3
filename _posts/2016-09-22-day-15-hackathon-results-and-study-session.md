Timeline:
* 0730-I open up the project and start work.  David’s already in, so I ask him about how I might stagger my JSON requests so that they execute in a particular order (since all JSON requests are asynchronous).  He’s got me up and running with a recursive chain of JSON queries inside of 15 minutes.  
* 1000-The groups take a blind vote and our group tied for second!  Alot better than my last two projects!  Quirkily enough the team that we tied with also did a Game of Thrones app.  
* 1100-Last algorithms challenge before the black belt exam.  We cover circular priority queues, as well the implementation of their push and pop methods.  
* 1200-The class is given a belt practice test, an app that involves the implementation of multiple tableViews, a spinner, a navbar, several navigation controllers, show and modal segues, as well CoreData.  Pretty much everything except JSON.
* 1945-Well, I’m not even halfway done, but I need to get home and get some sleep prior to tomorrow's test.

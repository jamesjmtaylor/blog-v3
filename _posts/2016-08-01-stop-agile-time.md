title: Stop! Agile Time!
---

It’s the first Monday of the week, which means it’s time for Agile! Major features implemented last month and not yet
mentioned include:

1. Finalize the blog page! (long)
2. Re-learn the rules to the game of life (John Conway’s game of life, not Hasbro’s) (short)
3. Look into participating in a Seattle Code Retreat.  This was mentioned on Software Engineering radio. 
 Unfortunately Seattle hasn’t had one since 2014 and isn’t set to have one for the foreseeable future (short).
4. Complete Lynda.com courses on Apache Cordova and Phonegap (long).
5. Install home security system (medium)

I know this doesn’t seem like much for a month’s worth of work, but July was pretty hectic overall.  We did just move
across the country and I’ve been averaging about a job interview a day since being up here. I’ll talk more about that
process in next week’s post. 

Planned features for the following month include:

1. Investigate Ionic (long).
2. Create a web app version of my WRD Calculator app (long).
3. Make a redundant android version of that app in Cordova (medium).
4. Buy a mac mini and get started with iOS development (1 week minimum).
5. Make an iOS version of that app in Cordova (long).
6. Investigate ATOM as an alternative to PuTTY for SSH into my Raspberry server (medium).
7. Study a back-end block of instruction from Lynda.com (long).
8. Study a Android Essential Training from Lynda.com (long).
9. Create a JS/HTML comments bar for each of my entries (long).
10. Gain HTML, CSS, JS, and Android certifications on upwork (long).

That’s a lot of features already.  I’ll see how it goes and let you know what comes of it.

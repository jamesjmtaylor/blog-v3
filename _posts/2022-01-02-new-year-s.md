Another year in the rearview mirror.  And a new year means new resolutions.  But before we get to that, here is a progress report of last year's resolutions. 

 I was able to resume programming in the mornings like I did when I first started in software.  I also completed my ESP32 FTMS cycling server (you can [download the source code here](https://github.com/jamesjmtaylor/esp32-ftms-server)).  Unfortunately I was unable to resume regular, in person boardgaming (for obvious reasons).  I was also unable to start on my stretch goal of a ruggedized ESP32 anemometer.  

For this year I plan to increase my 50 pushup pre-requisite for beer to 100 pushups, with the caveat that I can swap in air squats, situps, and pullups as necessary. I'm also training to complete my first ever century.  A century is a 100 mile bike ride, and I'm planning to compete in the Reach the Beach race.  

For software goals, I plan to update my 2015 Worldwide Equipment Guide app, both on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/worldwide-equipment-guide-2015/id1392413944) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamestaylor.weg&hl=en_US&gl=US).  I hope to update the source code from Storyboards & XML to Swift UI and Jetpack Compose.  I already did so for my iOS and Android BLE apps, and I don't anticipate it being too much of a lift for the WEG apps.  A more fundamental improvement to the apps will be updating them to be completely offline.  I had originally made them to interface with a RESTful API that I had built under the idea that I could add new equipment without requiring app updates.  But equipment additions have been so infrequent that I've realized that a REST API is a bit overkill.  

I'm seriously considering competing in a leetcode or HackerRank programming contest this year. I joined a CTF team this year on a lark and had a ton of fun.  But pursuing such a course will be contingent on the completion of my WEG app updates.  More to follow.

Until next time!

I've been pretty busy lately, so I figured it would be a good time to do a new year's resolution check-in. If you haven't read my 2024 resolutions post [you can do so here](https://jjmtaylor.com/2024-resolutions), but to recap I had three primary goals:

* Update my Worldwide Equipment Guide app to use the new Odin API
* Climb three new mountains.
* Complete Intermediate Climbing School (ICS)

That first goal is appearing like its increasingly less likely to happen this year.  Since writing that post one of my old co-workers approached me with a contracting opportunity.  That opportunity has turned into a regular part-time job that has more or less consumed all the free time that I would normally spend on personal projects, and at this point it looks like it could continue all the way into next year.

I completed my second goal in July with my summit of Colchuck Peak via the Colchuck Glacier route.  To date I've climbed 5 mountains this year, 3 of which were new, and successfully summited 4.

I've also started my third goal of completing ICS.  I was one of the 44 students accepted this year, and started the course this month.  Assuming nothing goes horribly awry, I should graduate in March of 2025.  

Short post for this month, so I'll leave you with a question: How are your new year's resolutions going?  Leave your answers in the comments!

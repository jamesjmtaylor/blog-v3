Timeline:
* 0820-Arrive (traffic from Federal Way was awful) make a minuet tweak to the TicTacToe App, submit it and start work on Tipster App (it says it’s supposed to take 4 hours, I’m going to try and complete it before 1100 algorithms.
* 0900-David briefly covers of auto layout. Afterwards I continue work on Tipster app.
* 1100-Algorithm time! We cover the recursion part of mergeSort.  I’m still not sure how partition fits into the picture.
* 1200-Break for lunch.  I borrow a deck to play a game of Magic: the Gathering (It’s been 11 years since I last played!)
* 1300-Apparently Thursdays are Sports days.  We go to the park and play a game of pickup basketball.  Another thing I haven’t done in a really long time.
* 1400-Back to the Tipster App.  I finally figure out how to assign a component a width that is a percentage of its parent.  After that I get into the logic and figure out exactly how Swift formats strings (it turns out it is very similar to java’s string formatter).
* 1800-Completed the Tipster App (Finally!)  It took six hours, 50% longer than the posted time estimate. To be fair I really focused on getting the Storyboard to look exactly like what was in post.  Started work on the Calculator app.
* 1945-Start the walk back to the parking lot.  Mostly played around with learning how to set percentage widths of components.

Timeline:

* 0800-It looks like that we’re going to be working with mapkit today, which is exciting because mapkit paired with CoreData has the potential to build some powerful geocaching apps.  Should be fun.
* 0900-This time I’m part of a group of three.  Our challenge is to create an app that uses Apple’s MapKit API.  We decided to build a Parkour Challenge app where you compete to get from point A to B on foot through the city.  It will use the user’s location to establish start and end points for a new course while the timer is running, and then they will be able to select other player’s routes from a ListView, with the start and end point from that past run placed on the map.
* 1100-We had to take a break from our app for algorithms.  Today we covered the implementation of removeAllNodes, toSortedArray, and nodeBeforeValue for our binary search tree on the whiteboard.  Nothing too challenging.
* 1700-Time to present!  Overall there were some pretty good submissions from the other teams.  I think ours was the most creative, but I’m a bit biased.  The other groups had a geography trivia game, a Yelp clone, and a social network game where you run to your nearest friend’s GPS location and annoy them.
* 1800-Heading home early today to celebrate my 28th birthday at home.

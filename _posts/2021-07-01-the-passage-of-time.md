It's been almost half a year since my last blog entry!  A lot has happened since then.  Stars were born and collapsed, civilizations rose and fell, planets formed and destroyed!  But in all seriousness I've been pretty busy.  At one point I had three separate part-time contracts in addition to my full time job.  I also changed jobs.  So I haven't had a lot of time leftover for blogging.  But I plan to resume my normal monthly cadence, and I've accumulated quite a few different topics to write about.  Over the coming months I plan to release entries on:

1. Lessons from my time at Nautilus.  This will cover a range of topics meandering from my experiences working with hardware all the way to my lessons learned in soft-skills. 
2. My new job at Q5id.  This current post is dated to be released on my first day at the company.  I should have a pretty good summary of the company by the time I need to write this post.
3. Kotlin Multi-Platform Project.  I delved into this as part of my contributions to <a href="https://github.com/Reedyuk/blue-falcon">the Blue Falcon Project</a>.  It's still early days, but the Kotlin MPP plugin for Android Studio was a big step forward.
4. Juggling individual development, side-hustles, a full-time job, and raising a family.  I've done a lot of growing over the last few months, and I'm pretty happy where I ended up on this topic.

That should provide a pretty good array of subject matter for the hopper.  Until next time!

Happy New Year!  I realize that I’ve been gone for a bit, but a lot has happened since.  I recently got a full time
position with Steelcase in Portland, Oregon as a software developer on their new mobile team.  The idea is that we’ll 
be integrating mobile applications with their furniture IoT.  IoT stands for “Internet of Things”, which is just a 
fancy way of summing up everything that’s connected to the internet, from the lowly bluetooth beacons all the way to 
the vaunted supercomputers of the modern age. I’ve worked with Steelcase for almost a month now and I wouldn’t dream of 
working anywhere else.  Excellent pay, great benefits, and extraordinarily helpful and friendly co-workers.  And a great
boss to boot.  But before I continue, just want to post the disclaimer that “the views expressed on this blog are mine
and do not necessarily reflect the views of Steelcase.”

Now that I’m in a full time job and ultimate aim of my personal branding website and blog are complete, I’m going to 
scale back my posts to about once a month.  I’ll stop with the Sprints format (I’m doing those at work now full-time as 
part of a team) and just write about personal projects, life events, and lessons learned.  I hope to have a comments 
section soon for my blog, as well as some pagination to cut down on load times, but until then just continue email 
comments, questions and suggestions to james.jm.taylor@gmail.com.

Before I leave you for the month I just wanted to post my New Year’s resolutions, since sharing your goals makes you 
more likely to achieve them.  My first goal is to do something professionally developing outside of work for 30 minutes 
each day, whether that’s writing this blog, studying, or working on tech-based side projects.  My second resolution is 
to fill the activity, calories, and standing circles of my Activity app on my apple watch every day (pretty lame, 
I know, but definitely attainable).  My third goal is publish an iOS version of my Worldwide Equipment Guide before 
the end of 2017. 

Well, that’s it for this month.  Until next time!

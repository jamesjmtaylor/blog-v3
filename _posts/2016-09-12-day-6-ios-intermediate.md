Timeline:

* 0745-I left around 0610 today, so I was able to get started a little earlier than normal.  For those of you that see the hour and a half difference I just want to say, do not be alarmed.  A good 20 minutes of that is just me walking the mile distance between the park and ride and the dojo.  As soon as I got there I talked to David about the wierd errors that I was getting.  It turned out to be two issues.  The simple one was that I had just forgotten to mention the protocol in the primary controller declaration.  The second issue was a little harder.  We ultimately tracked it down to a a misspelled connection name that had been corrected to the proper spelling in the .swift file but not the storyboard.   We fixed the two problems in about thirty minutes and I learned some cool debugging to boot.

* 0900-David calls the class to attention and we discuss the general concepts of iOS ListViews.  I continue work on the assigned Bucket List app.
* 1100-Algorithms!  We cover basic data structures and focus on binary search trees.  We’re tasked to whiteboard out implementation of BST insert and contains methods. 
* 1200-The class is released for lunch.  I implement the two whiteboard algorithms in Swift and post it to the class Slack channel.
* 1300-After a 10 minute walk around the block for some fresh air I continue work on the Bucket List App.  I’m now refactoring it to use only one modal connection between the two viewControllers instead of the two that I was using previously.  
* 1500-David gathers everybody to the whiteboard again and we discuss implementation of a protocol’s methods in a class.  Everyone pairs up and we create a basic whiteboard implementation of a person implementing the polite protocol with a single required greeting method.
* 1700-I finish up the second version of the Bucket List App and start work on the third version, which implements the CoreData Library, a Cocoa Object Model Database API.  I’m already ahead, so I plan to leave as soon as the worst of the traffic dies down.
* 1900-Heading out.  The database add logic works, it just doesn’t display until the app is restarted.  A problem for tomorrow.

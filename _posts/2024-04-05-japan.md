This post is going to be pretty short.  Our family will be in Japan next month for some much deserved rest and relaxation over spring break.  While there, we plan to visit Tokyo, Nagoya, Kochi, Kagoshima, Nagasaki, Kyoto, and Fuji.  

This will be the first time that any of us have been to Japan, and we've been cramming in as much Japanese culture as we can in preparation.  Studio Ghibli movies, sushi and bento boxes, the Shogun miniseries, and the Shogun 2 game have all taken center stage.  All as we try to saturate ourselves so that we can maximize our appreciation of the real thing while we're there.

I've been a Nipponophile for a while now, particularly with regards to their unique martial culture and discipline.  It seems like half of my Japanese vocabulary is just military jargon: no-dachi, sengoku jidai, naginata, Bushido, shuriken, ashigaru, etc. Meanwhile the rest of my family will probably be more interested in Kawaii, or the culture of cuteness, in Japan.

Fortunately we should have enough time to enjoy both aspects while there.  What about you?  Do you have any big trips planned for Spring Break or the Summer?  Let us know in the comments!

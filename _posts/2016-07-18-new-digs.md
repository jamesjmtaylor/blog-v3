![Twillight house](/blog-v3/assets/house.jpg)

We pulled into our new home last Friday.  It feels great to be back in the Pacific Northwest!

While I was on the road I had a lot of time to think, and I’m going to scale back on the whole ‘Agile Blog’ thing.  I realized that listening to me go on ad nauseam about features implemented and features planned for the week would be about as much fun for readers as watching paint dry.  So instead I’ll scale it back to the
first monday of each month, with the remainder of the blog entries dedicated to a hardware or software review, an especially applicable life lesson acquired in the transition from Soldier to civilian, or just random, developer related thoughts.  If you’d like me to adjust any of my content just let me know in the comments below.

In other news, the house is great!  It’s got enough bedrooms for everybody and garage to boot. It’s in an awesome neighborhood and is within a half mile of an elementary school, a fire station and a sheriff’s office.  It’s also only a 40 minute commute to the center of either Seattle or Tacoma.  Best part of being out of the Army so far: picking where I live!

NOTE: For safety reasons, the picture posted for this entry is not an actual photograph of my house.\
It’s a picture from the house the Edward lived in in the movie Twillight.  My real house is much better and filled with significantly fewer teenage-angst filled vampires.

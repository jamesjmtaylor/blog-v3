* 0730-It’s the last day of Coding Dojo.  I’ve got mixed feelings about it.  On the one hand I’m sad to be leaving a place where I learned so much so fast.  On the other I’m excited and anxious to start my job search.  
* 0900-Another mini-scrum.  I’m going for quick-win objectives at this point.  Add background music.  Touch up the interface.  Fix bugs.  My only major objective is to implement the head-to-head interface and my chances of completing that prior to presentation seem dubious at best.
* 1100-One last algorithms whiteboarding session. We’re covering graph breadth-first search and depth-first search.  This is actually an area that I feel pretty comfortable in given my previous experience with graphs.  We worked our way though both over the course of an hour and afterwards I took a brief walk through Bellevue.
* 1700-Well, that’s it.  Coding Dojo complete.  I’ll hold off on a final review for two months (or after I have a job, whichever is first).  That will not only allow me time to ruminate on the quality of the training, but also give me an opportunity to test their career placement services.  I’ll also return to my regular schedule of weekly updates.

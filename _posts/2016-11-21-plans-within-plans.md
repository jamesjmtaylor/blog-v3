 Well, as Eisenhower once said “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”  The week before last I received opportunities to interview at Steelcase, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC), as well as several smaller startups.  Steelcase alone has occupied 16 hours of time, primarily due to the six hour round-trip commutes both of the two-hour in-person interviews have necessitated. Additionally, the WA UTC position has prompted me to revisit my studies of C#, which I’m honestly a little rusty on. Not to mention that I have follow-up interviews to conduct next week.

Needles to say, I’m probably going to have to scrap this month’s Agile plan.

But the final intent of my sprints was never to just complete a bunch of cool personal projects.  They were ultimately aimed at securing a job.  So the plan within the original Agile plans appears to finally be coming to fruition.  Both Steelcase and UTC look like they’d be awesome places to work, and if I strike out on both I’ve still picked up enough bit contracts from Seattle Startup Week to last me a while.  

As always, I’ll keep you posted.

Timeline:
* 0730-Arrived early to try and complete the most challenging aspects of the assignment.  Evan (one of the other classmates) has already given most of the class a link to a good tutorial on searchBar implementation.  In exchange I gave a whiteboard presentation on implementing button press responses from a button within a custom cell (which is less than trivial because that button has no knowledge of the CoreData object that it’s cell represents).  
* 0900-Black belt time.  I’ll let you know how I did in 270 minutes.
* 1330-Alright, my code’s submitted and I earned a perfect score!  It was really close though because halfway through the project my CoreData was corrupted throughout the entire project file so I had to start from scratch.  After the test Bayne, my neighbor, said he had the exact same problem and to start over as well.  Just one of the many bugs of xCode 8 I guess.  I’m going to decompress for a bit and then get back to coding
* 1430-Jack, one of the other instructors has built a slither.io imitation in javascript.  The catch is that you program an AI to control the snake rather than controlling it yourself.  My interest is piqued, so I think I’ll go ahead and give it a shot. 
* 1700-Time to head home.  I’ll start my project on Monday.

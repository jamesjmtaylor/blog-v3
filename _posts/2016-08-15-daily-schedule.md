If you haven’t already, I’d highly recommend looking into the website and app 
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/" title="Meetup" target="_blank" rel="external">Meetup</a>. 
I’m a member of several groups local to the Seattle area, namely 
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Dev-Bootcamp-Seattle/" title="Dev Bootcamp Seattle" target="_blank" rel="external">Dev Bootcamp Seattle</a>,
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/techinterviews/" title="Seattle Tech Interviews" target="_blank" rel="external">Seattle Tech Interviews</a>, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Tech-Mentors/" title="Seattle Tech Mentors" target="_blank" rel="external">Seattle Tech Mentors</a>. 

It was at the last one specifically that the topic of daily routine came up.  I asked one of the tech mentors at the meetup what their schedule was like.  What surprised me was how similar mine was to his.  Specifically he would get up around 0500, work on algorithms and data structure questions for 2-3 hours on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" title="HackerRank" target="_blank" rel="external">HackerRank</a>, apply to new positions and respond to recruiter
emails for a couple hours, work on his website for three or four hours, and network at meetups throughout the evening. I have a very similar battle-rhythm.  The only exception is that I work a little more on learning new languages on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" title="Lynda" target="_blank" rel="external">Lynda</a> and little less on my website. 

My point besides all this however is that you more or less have to throw yourself into your work in order to be successful.  He followed this routine for a month and a half after graduating from the Coding Dojo 3-stack program. I’ve followed it for about a month.  My goal is to have a job a month after graduating from Coding Dojo (which I start in September!)  I’ll let you know how it goes.

PS: In order to avoid market saturation I'll hold off on any more Star Wars related memes for a while.  I promise

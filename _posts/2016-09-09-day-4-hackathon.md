Timeline:
* 0745-Continue work on the Calculator App.
* 0900-A Hackathon is announced and we’re broken up into teams of 2-3 and told to have a game prepared for submission by 1700.  I also completed the layout of the calculator app and implemented some basic logic.
* 1100-Algorithm Time! The themesong for algorithms has become [He-Man HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZ5LpwO-An4), which actually does a pretty good job of pumping me up.  I’m still a little bummed that we have to take a break from building our games though (our group picked chess)
* 1200-Back to building our app.  We’ve got our layout built and all that’s left is the logic.
* 1700-Everyone assembles in the fishbowl (a classroom which has glass for one of its four walls).  There are a total of 5 apps.  The most impressive one integrated music, sound effects, and sliding blocks as part of a sliding puzzle game.  The other apps include a simon-like game that you pass between you and your friend, as well as a word unscrambler app.
* 1800-Back to working on the calculator app.  Our homework for Monday is to complete the calculator app, the Great Game app, and the first assignment in next week’s reading.
* 1900-I stop working for now and prepare to head home.

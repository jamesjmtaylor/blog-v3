Well, my monthly objectives shifted again before I was able to fully realize them.  I got pulled off my personal projects by an outside offer to work on an iOS and Android travel app in my spare time.  I’m sinking a lot of time into it in order to get everything to match the designer's specifications, but it’s really rewarding to implement something so artfully envisioned.  The designer is using https://app.zeplin.io/ and https://proto.io/ in order to share the look and feel of the app, as well as the image assets.  I’ve got about a third of the iOS application implemented so far, but we’re still waiting on a back-end developer to pick up the slack on developing the middleware API.  I could 
do the back-end myself, but that would mean doubling the time to market.  In the meantime I’ll just continue to flesh out the front-end, leaving ‘TODO’ notes as I come across likely locations for API calls and the like.  

I still really want to include pagination in this website, as well as eventually migrate to either Angular 2 or React. But I don’t see actually being able to do either of these at least for another month.  Until then...

Well, this is a little embarrassing, but I need to postpone the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile blog once again.  You see, there was a pretty radical change of plans last month due to an unforeseen opportunity.  But to talk about that we need to go back in time all the way to 2021.

I joined the Mazamas, a mountaineering education organization, in 2021.  In order to participate in any of the climbs however you must be a graduate of BCEP (Basic Climbers Education Course). Last year several thousand people applied for one of the 250 student reservations, including me.  Like most people, I was waitlisted.  But at the end of April I was offered the opportunity to attend a Mazamas pilot program, the Introduction to Alpine Climbing course. The course would fulfill the same requirements as BCEP.  I leapt at the opportunity.  The last month has been a whirlwind of training and preparation on the weekdays and field exercises on the weekends.  It reminds me a little bit of being in the Army again.  Unfortunately it hasn't left a lot of time for personal programming projects, so my KMM work has languished.  

The course concludes at the end of this month, with a single post-class climb scheduled tentatively for the end of July.  By then I should be able to take up the KMM gauntlet once more.  As always, I'll keep you posted!

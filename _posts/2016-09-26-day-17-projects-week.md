Timeline:
* 0745-I applied to some jobs on Saturday.  It usually takes a couple weeks for responses to percolate, so I figure it’s a good time to get cracking.  
* 0900-David’s out sick, so Michael goes through the basics of project week and provides some initial guidance to the groups on their ideas.
* 1100-For algorithms we cover the trie data structure and implement .insert and .first methods.
* 1900-I’ve got the basic interface for my Gwent game built.  Tomorrow I’ll work on parsing the JSON from the Gwent API.

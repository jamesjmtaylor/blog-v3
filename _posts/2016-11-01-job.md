I got a job!  It’s a contract position to develop an iOS app and an Android app for a recruiting agency known as eXcell.  I unfortunately can’t discuss the details of the contract proposal or the app due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that I signed, but after hearing the pitch from the project manager I’m confident I have the skills to implement what they’re looking for.  I have to say that if it hadn’t been for my time at Coding Dojo, I wouldn’t have even begun to have considered myself qualified.  It’s only two months in duration, but it’ll be good to add some professional experience in software development to my resume.

Timeline:
* 0800-Yeah!  Phone’s fixed, I’m caught up in the lesson modules, I’ve got my 80’s movies soundtrack going and a hot cup of coffee at my side.  Time to get to work.
* 0900-Finished implementing the Binary Search Tree height() and isBalanced() functions in Swift 3, just in time for the first lecture of the day.  David addresses modal segues and show segues as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses.  Then we’re cut loose to work on the My Dogs assignment (which is no longer optional) and the Frameworks module. 
* 1100-As always, 1100 means algorithms time.  David has started playing the He-man video on the projector preceding every algorithms session, and it’s pretty awesome.  Today we’re covering the remove function of the binary search tree. It requires a surprisingly nuanced implementation.
* 1200-Lunch, followed by a class excursion to the park lasting an hour.
* 1400-I re-start work on the MyDogs problem.  We’re supposed to have it finished before tomorrow morning, presumably to allow us to do another Hackathon.
* 2100-The My Dogs is almost complete.  I have a few bugs to work through but the core functionality is implemented.  Two videos that David uploaded to the slack channel explaining how to convert a given image to it’s url string and back for CoreData storage were really helpful.  I’m looking forward to tomorrow.

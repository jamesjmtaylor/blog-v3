We had a pretty good Halloween at the Taylor household this Wednesday.  This was our first Halloween in the neighborhood, since we moved just this summer, so we weren't sure how common trick-or-treaters would be.  I'd say our new cul-de-sac is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.  Not the swarms of locusts that I've seen in some neighborhoods, but not entirely dead either.   And to parody that last paragraph, I give you [this Andy Rooney montage.](https://youtu.be/XIpGTcR2kAQ?t=8)

We also had midterm elections, and a number of candidates were definitely spooky enough.  Even if I had wanted to vote along party lines, I found it pretty much unconscionable to do so.  Let me explain... 

Over the last month or so I've willfully ignored any political advertisements, either change the station, fast-forwarding through the commercial, or turning it off entirely.  My rationale was that one of the biggest issues facing the country today is campaign finance.  I don't think it should make one lick of difference how much money you spend on a campaign, you should ultimately be elected on your stated accomplishments and goals moving forward.  The Oregon ballot comes with a voter's information pamphlet where for a fee of $600 you can place a statement for your platform. [ If you can't afford that you can apply for an exemption.](https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/filevoterspamphlet.aspx)  What shocked me was that some candidates didn't even file a statement.  My ultimate position with such candidates was that if they couldn't be bothered to post their stance in a public document, I couldn't be bothered to vote for them.  What was particularly odd was the distribution of those that didn't post anything.  Pretty much all the independent candidates had a statement of some kind.  But Republicans and Democrats time and time again neglected to post any information.  So independent it was for me. 

NOTE: The weird pumpkin on the left is supposed to be the Kotlin bird.  My apologies to the graphic artists responsible for the original design for my poor imitation :)

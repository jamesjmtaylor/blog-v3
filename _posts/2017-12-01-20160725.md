 Way back in 2008 I was a sophomore at West Point.  I had to pick a major that I would pursue for the next three years. Unlike most schools, I’d be more or less stuck with what I picked because changing my major halfway through and staying in school for another year was not an option. I had narrowed my choices down to Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science.  I had considered Chemical Engineering at the onset of college, but had ruled it out after the joy that was organic chemistry my 2nd semester of freshman year.  Civil and Mechanical Engineering were my staple choices going in.  But after IT155, advanced introduction to information and computer technologies, Computer Science suddenly became a contender (I had never written any code prior to that course).

I ultimately decided on computer science, for several reasons.  First, employment projections were very promising, guaranteeing a job on the outside should I determine a career in the military wasn’t for me.  Second, I was and still am a huge science fiction fan.  Computer Science to me seemed about as close as you could get to the cutting edge of technology, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it.  Finally, I figured it was the most pragmatic choice given the eventual rise of Skynet. 

 If you can’t beat em’, join em’, right?
